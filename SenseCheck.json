        "text": "Investors expected an even stronger beat and were disappointed by the guidance.",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Stocks can drop after an earnings beat if investors expected even better results or were disappointed by weak guidance. Markets are forward-looking, so cautious commentary on soft outlooks often outweigh solid historical results."

        "text": "The bank announced a dividend increase, which signals lower growth opportunities.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "A dividend increase is generally seen as a sign of financial strength and confidence in future cash flow, especially for banks. While it's true that very high payouts can suggest limited reinvestment opportunities, that interpretation is more relevant for high-growth tech companies than for mature financial institutions. In most cases, investors welcome dividend increases, and they are not typically the cause of a post-earnings sell-off."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Bank earnings can be complex, but widespread misunderstanding due to accounting is rare, especially among institutional investors who closely track these reports. If there were confusion, it would likely lead to temporary volatility, not a sustained drop in the stock. Moreover, if the earnings result clearly beat expectations, the numbers were at least broadly understood — so a market reaction driven purely by confusion is unlikely."

        "isCorrect": true,
        "explanation": "Strategic partnerships with established players often signal future growth potential and market validation, especially for startups. Investors are reacting to the anticipated increase in credibility, sales channels, or operational scale, which can drive higher future cash flows."

        "text": "The market expects the startup to receive a one-time cash payment from the partner, boosting short-term profits.",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "While partnerships may involve some financial incentives, the market typically reacts more to long-term implications than short-term gains. A one-time cash infusion would not justify a large move unless it materially altered the company’s runway or strategy."

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "While short covering can amplify a rally, it's unlikely to be the primary reason for a sharp upward move in response to fundamentally positive news. The core driver here is a reevaluation of future prospects, not technical positioning alone."

    {
      "id": "A",
      "text": "Investors are rotating out of defensive sectors as economic growth accelerates.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "While sector rotation can occur in early-cycle recoveries, this specific drop is linked to rising Treasury yields. A general growth-driven rotation might hurt utilities, but the key driver here is the change in discount rates, not macro growth expectations alone."
    },
    {
      "id": "B",
      "text": "Higher yields make bonds more attractive relative to income-generating equities like utilities.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "explanation": "Utility stocks are often valued for their dividend yields, making them sensitive to interest rate changes. When long-term Treasury yields rise, fixed-income alternatives become more attractive, and the present value of future cash flows from utilities declines, causing their stock prices to fall."

      "id": "C",
      "text": "The company’s debt costs immediately rose due to the higher Treasury yields.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "While rising rates can affect future borrowing costs, most corporate debt is fixed-rate. The impact on actual financing costs is gradual, not immediate. The stock drop is more directly tied to valuation pressures from higher discount rates rather than sudden changes in cost of capital."

  "options": [

      "id": "A",
      "text": "The cash-burning company, because its value depends more on distant future cash flows.",
      "isCorrect": true,

      "text": "The profitable company, because it already has cash flows to discount.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "While all companies are affected by rising rates, profitable firms have less sensitivity because their valuations rely more on near-term earnings. The market penalizes long-duration assets more—those with cash flows far in the future."

      "isCorrect": false,

      "id": "B",
      "text": "The company may be hitting demand elasticity limits, risking future volume declines.",
      "isCorrect": true,
